Our population analysis includes a set of visualizations aimed at providing insights into the demographic distribution within our dataset. The visualizations cover a range of key aspects, including population by age group, distribution by gender, location, and over time. A bar plot is utilized to display the total population for each age group, offering a clear visual overview of the population distribution across different age groups. Additionally, a histogram is used to showcase the population distribution by gender, illustrating the frequency of population values for males and females in the dataset. Furthermore, a bar plot is generated to present the top 10 locations with the highest population, providing valuable insights into the distribution of population across different locations. The time-based trends in population are illustrated using a line plot, showcasing how the total population changes over the years in the dataset. Moreover, a grouped bar plot is included to compare the population of different age groups between males and females, offering a comprehensive view of population distribution based on age groups and gender. To generate these visualizations, the provided Python code utilizes popular data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. These visualizations can be customized as needed based on specific dataset and analysis requirements.
